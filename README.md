Project Description: Real-Time Color Detection and Identification
This project is a real-time color detection application that allows users to capture colors from a live video feed, identify their RGB and HEX values, and determine the closest color name. The program uses the computer's camera to display the video feed, and when the user clicks on a point in the video, the color at that point is analyzed. The detected color information is then displayed on an overlay, including the color's name, HEX code, and RGB values.

Features:
Real-Time Color Detection: Capture colors directly from the video feed using your webcam.
Color Information Display: View the color name, RGB values, and HEX code of the detected color.
User-Friendly Interface: Click anywhere on the video feed to instantly get color details.
Libraries Used:
OpenCV (cv2): OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is used for capturing video from the webcam, processing the image, and drawing overlays on the video feed. It's a powerful library for computer vision tasks.
NumPy (numpy): NumPy is used for efficient numerical operations, such as averaging pixel values to determine the color.
Webcolors (webcolors): Webcolors is used to map RGB values to their nearest color name, which is particularly useful for identifying colors in a human-readable format.
How to Run the Project on Your PC:
Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Before running the code, ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy webcolors
Step 2: Clone the Repository
Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory
Move into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd color-detection
Step 4: Run the Application
Run the Python script to start the color detection application:

bash
Copy code
python color_detection.py
Step 5: Using the Application
Once the application is running, the video feed from your webcam will be displayed in a window titled "Video Feed."
Click anywhere on the video feed to detect the color at that point. A new window titled "Color Info" will appear, displaying the color name, HEX code, and RGB values.
Press x to exit the application.
Project Structure:
color_detection.py: The main script that contains all the code for the application.
Notes:
Ensure that your webcam is working and properly connected to your computer.
The program captures video from the default camera. If you have multiple cameras or the default camera index doesn't work, you can try changing the camera index in the cv2.VideoCapture(0) line.
